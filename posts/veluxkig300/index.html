But there seemed to be not much information on these devices and how you can use them so I figured I would jot down my notes. I&rsquo;m not too unhappy about it but for ~90eur I think it&rsquo;s quite expensive for what it does.</p><h2 id=my-setup>My setup<a href=#my-setup class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h2><p>I have two Velux MSL blinds with KLI300 controllers. The gateway pairs with the controllers via the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.velux.active&hl=en&gl=UShttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.velux.active&hl=en&gl=US">VELUX ACTIVE with NETATMO application</a>. Essentially you press a magic pair button on the remote and then add the blind to be controlled.</p><h2 id=home-assistant>Home assistant<a href=#home-assistant class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h2><p>Home assistant can use the <a href=https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/homekit/>homekit integration</a> and will report multiple covers. Currently it seems the position indicator is not working but it works in the VELUX app so I assume if I kicked it a little more I could make it work.</p><h3 id=alternatives>Alternatives<a href=#alternatives class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h3><p>With a shelly UNI someone made a really nice way to remote control the controller, I leave the post <a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/pzhkia/hack_velux_kli3xx_to_use_blinds_without_gateway/>here</a>. I chose not to do this as the setup looked a little messy and would need quite some work to clean up but also there is then no way to get state/position information on the blind.</p><p>Also other Velux gateways like the older KLF200 are likely simpler and nicer to use but they are more expensive, ~150EUR at the time of writing.</p></div></div><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__title><span class=pagination__title-h>Read other posts</span><hr></div><div class=pagination__buttons><span class="button previous"><a href=https://arfoll.github.io/posts/gls10/><span class=button__icon>‚Üê</span>
