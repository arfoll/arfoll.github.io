In order to do this you need to buy the velux gateway KIG300 which is often sold as a kit with some temp/humidity sensor which I didn&amp;rsquo;t get.
The annoying thing with this setup is that it&amp;rsquo;s using the apple homekit integration as well as requiring a smartphone app for the initial setup, pairing this with a network that has no internet is also a little tricky, so this is by far not my favourite solution.</description><content>&lt;p>If you have some Velux blinds (SSL, MSL) or windows which use the velux ACTIVE branding you likely can hook them up to control them remotely.

&lt;p>The annoying thing with this setup is that it&amp;rsquo;s using the apple homekit integration as well as requiring a smartphone app for the initial setup, pairing this with a network that has no internet is also a little tricky, so this is by far not my favourite solution. But there seemed to be not much information on these devices and how you can use them so I figured I would jot down my notes. I&amp;rsquo;m not too unhappy about it but for ~90eur I think it&amp;rsquo;s quite expensive for what it does.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="my-setup">My setup&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I have two Velux MSL blinds with KLI300 controllers. The gateway pairs with the controllers via the &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.velux.active&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;gl=UShttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.velux.active&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;gl=US">VELUX ACTIVE with NETATMO application&lt;/a>. Essentially you press a magic pair button on the remote and then add the blind to be controlled.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Home assistant can use the &lt;a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/homekit/">homekit integration&lt;/a> and will report multiple covers. Currently it seems the position indicator is not working but it works in the VELUX app so I assume if I kicked it a little more I could make it work.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="alternatives">Alternatives&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>With a shelly UNI someone made a really nice way to remote control the controller, I leave the post &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/pzhkia/hack_velux_kli3xx_to_use_blinds_without_gateway/">here&lt;/a>. I chose not to do this as the setup looked a little messy and would need quite some work to clean up but also there is then no way to get state/position information on the blind.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also other Velux gateways like the older KLF200 are likely simpler and nicer to use but they are more expensive, ~150EUR at the time of writing.&lt;/p></content></item></channel></rss>
